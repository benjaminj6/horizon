## Roadmap

  1. Make currentIndex automatically update upon reaching the next breakpoint
  2. Move timer actions into a dedicated async thunk.
    - Will need to perform checks on every second
      1. Check current index --> update relevant data if necessary (target, index, remaining, etc)
  3. Add branding (github, link to my site, etc)
  4. Feature -- add an info page that simply displays all relevant times.
    - Links to article re: civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight
