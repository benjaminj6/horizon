## Roadmap

  1. TESTING -- 100% coverage?
  3. Add branding (github, link to my site, etc)
  4. Feature -- add an info page that simply displays all relevant times.
    - Links to article re: civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight


  5. Correctly calibrate sunrise/sunset level
    -- currently 50 -- seems like it would work better at 40
