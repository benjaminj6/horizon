// Need to initialize the timer
// Every ms need to run a few checks

  // if remaining <= 999 (under 1 sec) --> update the currentIndex
  // if it is currently sunset refresh AM times (currentIndex == target --> sunset )
  // if is currently sunrise refresh PM times (currentIndex == target --> sunrise)


// Need an action to stop the timer
